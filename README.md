# ExcelExport
Program written in Python, used to export data from excel files and generate SQL commands for use in a database system.  
Supports `INSERT` SQL commands with future plans to support other SQL commands such as `UPDATE` and `CREATE TABLE`.

With enough data in the excel file, the automation process greatly reduces manual labour.

## Running The Program
Enter the following command from the root directory:  
`python main.py`
